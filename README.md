# Minimal drive system for the ESP32 #

This sketch provides a basic drive system running on the ESP32. It depends on the [Reeltwo](https://reeltwo.github.io/Reeltwo) library. It is configured to use a single PS3 Navigation controller, but you can also use a regular PS3 or PS4 controller with minimal changes.
